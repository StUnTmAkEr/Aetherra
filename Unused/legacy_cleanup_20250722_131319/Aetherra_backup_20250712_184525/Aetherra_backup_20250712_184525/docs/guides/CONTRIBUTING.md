### [TOOL] Code Contributions

#### Setting Up Development Environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Aetherra.git
cd Aetherra
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Running Tests
```bash
python test_core_features.py
python test_gui_import.py
python comprehensive_analysis.py
```

#### Development Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines (enforced by Ruff)
- Add comprehensive docstrings to new functions
- Include test cases for new features
- Update documentation when adding new Aetherra syntax

### 🧠 Areas We Need Help With

#### **🚀 Core Performance Enhancements**

- **Adaptive Functions**: Code that learns from usage patterns

#### **🌐 Ecosystem Integration**
- **Universal Language Bridge**: Python, JavaScript, Rust, Go integration
- **AI Tool Compatibility**: GitHub Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT coordination
- **Enterprise Features**: Production deployment, security, compliance
- **Developer Tools**: VS Code, JetBrains, Vim extensions

#### **🤖 Autonomous Development**
- **Self-Healing Systems**: Auto-detection and fixing of production issues
- **Collective Intelligence**: Global knowledge sharing across instances
- **Continuous Learning**: Real-time adaptation from developer patterns
- **Innovation Discovery**: AI-discovered programming techniques

#### **📚 Traditional Areas (Still Important)**
- **Language Features**: New Aetherra syntax patterns
- **AI Integration**: Better natural language processing
- **Performance**: Optimization of the interpreter engine
- **Documentation**: Examples, tutorials, and guides
- **Testing**: Edge cases and integration tests
- **Plugins**: New plugins for the ecosystem

### 📋 Contribution Process
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### 💭 Philosophy
Remember that Aetherra is about **cognitive programming** - expressing intentions rather than implementations. When contributing, think about:
- How does this make programming more intuitive?
- Does this help developers express **what** they want rather than **how** to do it?
- Can AI understand and act on this pattern?
