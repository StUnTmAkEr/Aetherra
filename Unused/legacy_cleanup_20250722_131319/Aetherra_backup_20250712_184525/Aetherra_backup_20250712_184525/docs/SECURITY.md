3. **⏰ Response Time**: We respond within **24 hours** for critical issues

### **Standard Vulnerability Reporting**
For general security concerns:

1. **📝 GitHub Issues**: Use the "Security" label on public issues for non-sensitive vulnerabilities
2. **💬 Community Discussion**: Engage in our security discussions forum
3. **⏰ Response Time**: We respond within **72 hours** for standard issues

### **What to Include**
Please provide:
- **📍 Affected Components**: Which modules, files, or features are impacted
- **🔍 Vulnerability Type**: Buffer overflow, injection, privilege escalation, etc.
- **📊 Impact Assessment**: Potential damage or exploitation scenarios
- **🛠️ Reproduction Steps**: Clear steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- **[TOOL] Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation
- **🌍 Environment Details**: OS, Python version, aetherra version

## 🎯 **Security Focus Areas**

### **🤖 AI Security**
- **Model Injection Attacks**: Preventing malicious prompts that could compromise AI behavior
- **Autonomous Action Safety**: Ensuring AI-generated code modifications are safe and authorized
- **Data Privacy**: Protecting sensitive data processed by AI models
- **Model Poisoning**: Preventing adversarial inputs that could corrupt AI decision-making

### **🔐 System Security**
- **Code Execution Safety**: Sandboxing and validation of autonomous code changes
- **File System Access**: Controlled access to user files and system resources
- **Network Security**: Secure API communications and data transmission
- **Privilege Escalation**: Preventing unauthorized system access

### **📊 Data Security**
- **Memory Protection**: Secure handling of persistent memory and learning data
- **API Key Security**: Safe storage and transmission of AI provider credentials
- **User Data Privacy**: Protection of conversation history and personal information
- **Backup Security**: Encrypted and secure backup systems

## 🛠️ **Security Measures in Place**

### **🔒 Built-in Safeguards**
```python
# Example security controls in aetherra
class SecurityManager:
    def validate_code_modification(self, file_path, changes):
        """Validate AI-suggested code changes for safety"""
        if self.is_system_file(file_path):
            return False, "System file modification not allowed"

        if self.confidence_score < 0.85:
            return False, "Confidence too low for auto-apply"

        if self.contains_dangerous_operations(changes):
            return False, "Potentially dangerous operations detected"

        return True, "Safe to apply"
```

### **🔍 Audit & Monitoring**
- **Complete Action Logging**: All AI decisions and modifications are logged
- **User Consent Required**: Explicit approval for sensitive operations
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Easy reversal of AI-applied changes
- **Sandbox Execution**: Isolated environments for code testing

### **🛡️ Access Controls**
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
- **File System Restrictions**: Limited access to critical system files
- **API Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse of external services
- **Configuration Hardening**: Secure default settings

## 🏆 **Security Best Practices**

### **For Users**
- **🔑 API Key Security**: Store API keys in environment variables, never in code
- **📁 File Permissions**: Review file access permissions regularly
- **🔄 Regular Updates**: Keep aetherra updated to latest secure version
- **💾 Backup Strategy**: Maintain secure backups before using autonomous features

### **For Developers**
- **🔒 Code Review**: All security-related changes require peer review
- **🧪 Security Testing**: Regular penetration testing and vulnerability scanning
- **📚 Security Training**: Stay informed about AI and software security best practices
- **🚨 Incident Response**: Know how to respond to security incidents

### **For Organizations**
- **🏢 Enterprise Controls**: Implement additional access controls and monitoring
- **📋 Policy Compliance**: Ensure compliance with organizational security policies
- **🔍 Audit Trails**: Maintain comprehensive logs for compliance and forensics
- **👥 User Training**: Educate users on responsible AI usage
