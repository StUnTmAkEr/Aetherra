# üõ°Ô∏è Aetherra Project Protection System

## Overview

The Aetherra Project Protection System is a comprehensive safeguard designed to prevent accidental deletion of critical project files and maintain automatic backups. This system was created after an incident where the main README.md was accidentally overwritten during website deployment.

## üö® What Happened (Learning from Mistakes)

**June 30, 2025**: During website deployment to fix GitHub Pages serving, the main project README.md was accidentally overwritten with the website README.md. This resulted in:

- ‚ùå Loss of current project documentation
- ‚ùå Incorrect information displayed on GitHub repository
- ‚ùå Hours of work to recover from git history

**Never again!** This protection system ensures critical files are always protected and backed up.

## üõ°Ô∏è Protection Features

### 1. **File Protection**
- **Protected Files**: Critical project files are protected from accidental deletion
- **Protected Directories**: Core directories cannot be accidentally removed
- **Extension Protection**: Important file types (.py, .aether, .md, etc.) are monitored

### 2. **Automatic Backups**
- **Daily Backups**: Automatic backups of all critical files
- **Version History**: Multiple backup versions maintained (configurable)
- **Timestamp Tracking**: Every backup includes creation timestamp
- **Smart Cleanup**: Old backups automatically removed based on retention policy

### 3. **Git Integration**
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Blocks commits that would delete protected files
- **Force Override**: Allows intentional deletion with reason logging
- **Deletion Logging**: All forced deletions are logged with user and reason

### 4. **Recovery System**
- **Easy Restore**: Simple commands to restore files from backups
- **Multiple Versions**: Choose which backup version to restore from
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles conflicts when restoring files

### PowerShell Commands (Windows)

```powershell
# Protection Management
.\protect.ps1 status           # Show protection status
.\protect.ps1 backup           # Create backups of critical files
.\protect.ps1 restore <file>   # Restore file from backup
.\protect.ps1 enable           # Enable file protection
.\protect.ps1 disable          # Disable file protection (with confirmation)
.\protect.ps1 install          # Install protection system
.\protect.ps1 help             # Show help information
```

### Python Commands (Cross-platform)

```bash
# Direct Python access
python scripts/project_protection.py status
python scripts/project_protection.py backup
python scripts/project_protection.py restore README.md
python scripts/project_protection.py force_delete README.md "Intentional removal for testing"
```

## [TOOL] Configuration

### Protection Settings (`.project_protection.json`)

```json
{
  "protection_enabled": true,           // Master enable/disable
  "auto_backup_on_edit": true,         // Auto-backup on file changes
  "block_git_deletion": true,          // Block git commits deleting protected files
  "require_reason_for_deletion": true, // Require reason for force deletion
  "backup_frequency": "daily",         // Backup frequency
  "max_backups": 30                    // Maximum backup retention
}
```

### Adding Protected Files

```json
{
  "protected_files": [
    "README.md",
    "your_critical_file.py"
  ],
  "protected_directories": [
    "core/",
    "your_important_dir/"
  ]
}
```

## üÜò Recovery Procedures

### Restore Accidentally Deleted File

```powershell
# Find available backups
.\protect.ps1 status

# Restore most recent backup
.\protect.ps1 restore path/to/file.py

# Restore specific backup (if you know timestamp)
python scripts/project_protection.py restore path/to/file.py 20250630_143022
```

### Force Delete Protected File (When Necessary)

```powershell
# This creates a backup and logs the deletion
python scripts/project_protection.py force_delete README.md "Replacing with new version"
```

### Disable Protection Temporarily

```powershell
# Disable with confirmation prompt
.\protect.ps1 disable

# Re-enable when ready
.\protect.ps1 enable
```

## üìä Status Monitoring

### Protection Status Report

```powershell
.\protect.ps1 status
```

**Example Output:**
```
üõ°Ô∏è Aetherra Protection Status:
  Protection Enabled: True
  Protected Files: 12/12
  Backup Count: 45
  Last Backup: 2025-06-30 14:30:22

## [WARN] Important Notes

### What Protection Does
- ‚úÖ Prevents accidental deletion of critical files
- ‚úÖ Creates automatic backups with timestamps
- ‚úÖ Blocks git commits that would delete protected files
- ‚úÖ Provides easy recovery mechanisms
- ‚úÖ Logs all forced deletions with reasons

### What Protection Doesn't Do
- ‚ùå Doesn't prevent file modifications (only deletion)
- ‚ùå Doesn't backup external dependencies
- ‚ùå Doesn't protect against hardware failures (use git!)
- ‚ùå Doesn't prevent intentional force deletion

### Best Practices

1. **Regular Backups**: Run `.\protect.ps1 backup` regularly
2. **Status Checks**: Monitor protection status weekly
3. **Reason Logging**: Always provide clear reasons for force deletions
4. **Git Integration**: Commit regularly to complement protection
5. **Configuration Review**: Review protected files list monthly

## üîÑ Integration with Development Workflow

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Normal commits work as usual
git add .
git commit -m "Update feature"

# If deleting protected files, commit will be blocked
git add .
git commit -m "Remove old file"  # BLOCKED if protected file deleted

# Use force delete when intentional
python scripts/project_protection.py force_delete old_file.py "No longer needed"
git add .
git commit -m "Remove deprecated file"
```

### VS Code Integration
The protection system works silently in the background. When you try to delete protected files in VS Code, the git pre-commit hook will prevent the commit and show guidance.

## üö® Emergency Recovery

### If Protection System is Corrupted

```powershell
# Restore protection configuration
git checkout .project_protection.json

# Reinstall protection system
.\protect.ps1 install

# Verify system is working
.\protect.ps1 status
```

### If All Backups are Lost

```bash
# Use git history as fallback
git log --oneline --follow README.md
git checkout <commit_hash> -- README.md
```

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues with the protection system:

1. **Check Status**: `.\protect.ps1 status`
2. **Verify Configuration**: Check `.project_protection.json`
3. **Check Backups**: Look in `backups/auto_backups/`
4. **Review Logs**: Check `backups/auto_backups/deletion_log.json`
5. **Git Fallback**: Use git history as backup

---

**Remember**: This protection system is a safety net, not a replacement for good version control practices. Always commit your work to git regularly!
