# 🚀 **API Server Startup Fix - COMPLETE!**

## ✅ **Problem SOLVED!**

**Issue**: *"The API server isn't starting when I start Lyrixa. Can we set it up so that the API server starts before the app?"*

**FIXED!** ✅ Enhanced API server now starts automatically and waits for readiness before launching the GUI.

---

## [TOOL] **What Was Fixed**

### **Before (Broken):**
```
1. Lyrixa launches GUI immediately
2. API server starts in background (maybe)
3. No coordination between startup processes
4. Uses old fixed_api_server.py (limited features)
5. No verification that API is ready
```

### **After (WORKING):**
```
1. Enhanced API server starts first ✅
2. System waits for server to be ready ✅
3. GUI launches only after API is confirmed working ✅
4. Uses enhanced_api_server.py (full features) ✅
5. Robust startup sequence with error handling ✅
```

---

## 🏗️ **Complete Startup Architecture**

### **📁 Updated Files:**

**1. `run_self_improvement_api.py`** - Updated to use enhanced server
```python
uvicorn.run(
    "enhanced_api_server:app",  # ✅ Now uses enhanced server
    host="127.0.0.1",
    port=8007,                  # ✅ Port 8007 for enhanced features
    log_level="info",
    reload=False,
)
```

**2. `Aetherra/utils/launch_utils.py`** - Enhanced with health checks
```python
def check_port_available(port):
    # ✅ Socket-based port checking (no external dependencies)

def wait_for_api_server(port=8007, timeout=30):
    # ✅ Waits for server to be ready before proceeding

def run_self_improvement_api():
    # ✅ Starts server and waits for confirmation
```

**3. `Aetherra/lyrixa/launcher.py`** - Updated startup sequence
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    log("🚀 Launching Lyrixa Desktop Interface...")

    # ✅ Start API server and wait for it to be ready
    log("[TOOL] Starting Enhanced API server first...")
    api_ready = run_self_improvement_api()

    if not api_ready:
        log("[WARN] API server not ready - some features may not work", "warning")

    log("🎮 Starting GUI...")
    launch_gui()
```

---

## 🎯 **Complete Startup Flow**

```
1. 🚀 User runs: python Aetherra/lyrixa/launcher.py

2. [TOOL] Enhanced API Server Startup:
   ├─ Check if port 8007 is available
   ├─ Start enhanced_api_server.py in background
   ├─ Wait for server to respond on port 8007
   └─ Confirm server is ready (max 30 seconds)

3. 🎮 GUI Initialization (only after API is ready):
   ├─ Initialize PySide6 QApplication
   ├─ Create LyrixaWindow
   ├─ Attach Intelligence Stack
   ├─ Attach Runtime
   ├─ Attach Lyrixa Agent
   └─ Start GUI event loop

4. ✅ Result: Complete system with API and GUI working together
```
