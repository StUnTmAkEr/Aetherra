# 🔗 GitHub Link Redirect Issue - Troubleshooting Guide

**Issue**: Clicking GitHub links on the website redirects to `VirtualVerse-Corporation/aetherra` instead of `Zyonic88/aetherra`

## 🔧 **SOLUTIONS TO TRY**

### **1. Clear Browser Cache (Recommended)**
```bash
# Chrome/Edge:
Ctrl + Shift + Delete → Clear browsing data → Cached images and files

# Firefox:
Ctrl + Shift + Delete → Clear cached web content

# Or use Private/Incognito mode to test
```

### **2. Hard Refresh the Website**
```bash
# Windows:
Ctrl + F5  or  Ctrl + Shift + R

# Mac:
Cmd + Shift + R
```

### **3. Clear DNS Cache (Windows)**
```powershell
# Run as Administrator:
ipconfig /flushdns
```

### **4. Test with Direct URL**
Open a new browser tab and go directly to:
```
https://github.com/Zyonic88/aetherra
```

### **5. Check if GitHub has URL Redirects**
The old repository might have a redirect set up. Try:
- Go to: https://github.com/VirtualVerse-Corporation/aetherra
- See if it automatically redirects to the new repository

## 🔍 **DIAGNOSIS**

The issue is most likely one of these:

1. **Browser Cache**: Your browser cached the old HTML files with old links
2. **GitHub Repository Redirect**: The old repository might have a redirect that's interfering
3. **DNS Cache**: Your system is resolving cached DNS entries

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE ACTION**

**Try this right now:**
1. Open an **incognito/private window** in your browser
2. Navigate to your website
3. Click the GitHub links
4. They should go to the correct repository: `Zyonic88/aetherra`

If the links work correctly in incognito mode, the issue is definitely browser cache.

## 📋 **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

✅ **Website Files Checked**: All GitHub links are correct
✅ **JavaScript Checked**: No redirect code found
✅ **Configuration Files**: No .htaccess or redirect files
✅ **Git Status**: All fixes committed and pushed
