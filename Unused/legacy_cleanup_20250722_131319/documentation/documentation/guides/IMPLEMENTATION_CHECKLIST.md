### [TOOL] Key Components to Implement

#### 1. Enhanced UI System
```python
# core/ui/interface.py
class LyrixaUI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.theme_manager = ThemeManager()
        self.command_suggestions = CommandSuggestions()
        self.status_display = StatusDisplay()

    def render_dashboard(self):
        # Real-time AI OS dashboard
        pass

    def show_progress(self, operation):
        # Visual progress indicators
        pass
```

#### 2. Advanced Memory Logging
```python
# core/memory/logger.py
class MemoryLogger:
    def __init__(self):
        self.storage = StructuredStorage()
        self.indexer = MemoryIndexer()
        self.analytics = MemoryAnalytics()

    def log_operation(self, operation, context, metadata):
        # Structured memory logging
        pass

    def search_memories(self, query, filters=None):
        # Advanced memory search
        pass
```

#### 3. Plugin Management System
```python
# core/plugins/manager.py
class PluginManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.registry = PluginRegistry()
        self.installer = PluginInstaller()
        self.validator = PluginValidator()

    def discover_plugins(self):
        # Plugin discovery with descriptions
        pass

    def install_plugin(self, plugin_id):
        # Guided plugin installation
        pass
```
