    • This triggered the goal_autopilot to retry 3 times
    • After max retries, the goal was escalated to escalation_mgr agent
    • The agent is now investigating alternative connection methods

    📊 Pattern Analysis:
    The API failures seem to coincide with the slow_responder_plugin issues,
    suggesting a potential network or performance bottleneck that needs attention.

    I've logged this correlation for the daily reflection system to analyze.

    • 94.7% goal completion rate (excellent)
    • Memory efficiency: 78% usage (optimal range)
    • Plugin availability: 91.7% (good)
    • Agent response time: <500ms average (excellent)

    ⚠️ Areas for Attention:
    • Network connectivity issues affecting API-dependent goals
    • One plugin showing performance degradation
    • Slight increase in error events (12 vs average of 8)

    [TOOL] Recommendations:
    • Schedule maintenance for slow_responder_plugin
    • Review network configuration for API connections
    • Continue current monitoring patterns
