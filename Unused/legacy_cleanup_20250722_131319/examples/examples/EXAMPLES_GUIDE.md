## üß¨ Example Walkthrough: Basic Memory

Let's explore how memory works in aetherra:

```aetherra
# üß† Memory is a first-class citizen in aetherra
remember("aetherra revolutionizes programming") as "core_insight"
remember("AI agents enhance human creativity") as "collaboration_principle"
remember("Memory enables learning and adaptation") as "architectural_foundation"

# Intelligent recall with semantic search
recall memories about "programming"
recall similar_to "collaboration"

# Memory connections and insights
memory: show connections between "AI" and "creativity"
memory: analyze patterns in "architectural" concepts
memory: suggest related topics for "learning"

# Goal-driven learning
goal: understand aetherra memory system priority: high
agent: on specialization: "education"

# AI analysis and suggestions
analyze "my understanding of memory concepts"
suggest "next steps for mastering aetherra"

# Continuous learning loop
when new_insight_gained:
    remember(insight) as "learning_progress"
    update: understanding_level
    suggest: "advanced topics to explore"
end
```

**What happens when you run this:**
1. **Memory Storage**: Information is stored with semantic tags
2. **Intelligent Recall**: AI finds related memories using vector similarity
3. **Pattern Analysis**: Connections between concepts are discovered
4. **Goal Coordination**: Learning objectives guide the AI agent
5. **Adaptive Suggestions**: Next steps are personalized to your progress

## ü§ù AI Collaboration Example

See how multiple AI agents work together:

```aetherra
# ü§ù Multi-Agent Architecture Design
goal: design scalable microservices system priority: critical
constraints: [high_availability, security, performance]

# Activate collaborative AI team
collaborate: solve "e-commerce platform architecture"
agents: [solution_architect, security_expert, performance_engineer, devops_specialist]

# Define problem scope
problem_context: |
  E-commerce platform requirements:
  - 100K+ concurrent users
  - Real-time inventory management
  - Secure payment processing
  - Global content delivery
  - Auto-scaling capabilities
|

# Agent specialization and coordination
assign: "overall system design" to solution_architect
assign: "security architecture" to security_expert
assign: "performance optimization" to performance_engineer
assign: "deployment strategy" to devops_specialist

# Collaborative workflow
when architect_proposes_design:
    security_expert: review_for_vulnerabilities
    performance_engineer: analyze_scalability
    devops_specialist: assess_deployment_complexity

    if all_agents_approve:
        proceed: with_implementation_planning
    else:
        iterate: design_based_on_feedback
    end
end

# Learning and improvement
reflect on "collaboration effectiveness"
remember("Multi-agent design produces better architecture") as "team_insight"
suggest "process improvements for future projects"
```

**Agent Coordination Flow:**
1. **Problem Analysis**: Each agent analyzes from their expertise
2. **Solution Generation**: Collaborative solution development
3. **Cross-Validation**: Agents review each other's contributions
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement through feedback
5. **Knowledge Retention**: Lessons learned for future projects

## üìä Data Analysis Example

AI-powered data insights in action:

```aetherra
# üìä Intelligent Data Analysis
goal: extract actionable insights from customer data priority: high
agent: on specialization: "data_science"

# Load and understand data
analyze "customer_behavior.csv" for "usage_patterns"
identify_trends: in "purchase_history"
detect_anomalies: in "user_engagement"

# AI-driven pattern recognition
find_correlations: between "demographics" and "preferences"
segment_customers: by "behavior_similarity"
predict: "churn_probability" for each "customer_segment"

# Insight generation
when pattern_discovered:
    validate: statistical_significance
    generate: business_recommendation
    remember(insight) as "data_driven_finding"
    suggest: "actionable_next_steps"
end

# Automated reporting
compile: findings into "executive_summary"
visualize: key_metrics as "interactive_dashboard"
schedule: "weekly_analysis_updates"

# Continuous learning
learn_from: "prediction_accuracy"
adapt: models_based_on "new_data_patterns"
improve: "analysis_methodology" over_time
```

**AI Analysis Process:**
1. **Data Understanding**: AI analyzes data structure and quality
2. **Pattern Discovery**: Automated detection of trends and anomalies
3. **Statistical Validation**: Confidence scoring for all findings
4. **Business Translation**: Technical insights become actionable recommendations
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Models learn and adapt over time

    generate: optimization_strategy
    test: solution_effectiveness
    apply: if_improvement_validated
end
```

### **Cross-Language Integration**
```aetherra
# Integrate with existing codebases
python_integration: |
    import pandas as pd
    data = pd.read_csv('large_dataset.csv')
    return ai_analysis(data)
|

remember(python_results) as "external_analysis"
