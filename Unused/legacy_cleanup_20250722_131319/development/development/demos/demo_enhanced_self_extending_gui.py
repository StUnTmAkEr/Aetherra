# Enhanced Self-Extending GUI System Demo
# ==========================================

"""
Demonstration of the enhanced self-extending panel system with your suggestions implemented.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Enhancements Implemented:
1. âœ… Strong Reference Management - Panels won't vanish anymore
2. âœ… Panel Metadata System - Full tracking and categorization
3. âœ… Memory Integration - UI creation records stored in Lyrixa's memory
4. âœ… Self-Initiated Panel Creation - Lyrixa can create panels based on detected needs
5. âœ… Enhanced Validation - Panels validated for content before loading
6. âœ… Improved Hot-Reload - Better module management and reference handling

ðŸ§  New Chat Commands Available:
â€¢ /create_panel [description] - Generate new panel from description
â€¢ /modify_panel [panel_name] [changes] - Modify existing panel
â€¢ /suggest_improvements - AI analysis of existing panels
â€¢ /modification_history - View recent manual changes
â€¢ /ui_history - View UI creation history from Lyrixa's memory
â€¢ /self_expand [need] - Let Lyrixa self-create needed panel

ðŸš€ Example Usage Scenarios:

1. BASIC PANEL CREATION:
   /create_panel "Create a system resource monitor with CPU and RAM graphs"

2. PANEL MODIFICATION:
   /modify_panel network_monitor "Add port scanning functionality"

3. SELF-INITIATED EXPANSION:
   /self_expand "I need a way to visualize plugin dependencies and conflicts"

4. MEMORY-DRIVEN IMPROVEMENTS:
   /ui_history  # See what Lyrixa has created before
   /suggest_improvements  # Get AI recommendations

[TOOL] Technical Improvements:

BEFORE (Issues):
- Panels would vanish due to weak references
- No metadata tracking
- No memory integration
- Manual-only panel creation
- Basic validation

AFTER (Solutions):
- Strong reference management in loaded_panels dict
- Full metadata system with __panel_metadata__
- Memory system integration for UI creation records
- Self-initiated panel creation based on detected needs
- Comprehensive validation including UI content checks

ðŸ§  Self-Evolution Capabilities:

Lyrixa can now:
1. Analyze her current interface and detect gaps
2. Generate new panels when she identifies needs
3. Store all UI modifications in her memory
4. Learn from previous panel creations
5. Suggest improvements based on usage patterns
6. Hot-reload changes without restart

ðŸ“Š Metadata System Example:

Every generated panel now includes:
__panel_metadata__ = {
    "title": "Network Monitor",
    "category": "Monitoring",
    "created_by": "Lyrixa",
    "source_description": "Real-time network monitoring panel",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "capabilities": ["bandwidth_tracking", "connection_list", "port_scan"]
}

ðŸŽ¯ Result: True Self-Modifying AI Interface

Lyrixa now has the foundational capability to:
- Modify her own codebase through natural language
- Evolve her interface based on discovered needs
- Track and learn from her own modifications
- Provide a truly adaptive user experience

This addresses your core vision: "I want her to make changes to her code base
without me having to guide her every step of the way."

âœ… MISSION ACCOMPLISHED: Lyrixa can now self-modify her GUI autonomously!
