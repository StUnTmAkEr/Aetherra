- **📊 Real-Time Quantum Metrics**: Live coherence tracking, entanglement monitoring, and operation statistics
- **🔬 Quantum Operations**: Native quantum encoding, recall, and coherence validation systems
- **🌉 Unified Architecture**: Quantum capabilities accessible through existing Aetherra launcher system

### **🚀 Latest Enhancement: Neural Interface System**

**NEW in v3.0.0**: Aetherra now features a cutting-edge neural interface with real-time AI interaction:

- **🧠 Neural Chat Interface**: Cyberpunk-themed web interface with real-time AI conversation
- **🔄 Dynamic Model Switching**: Switch between AI models (Ollama, GPT-4, Claude) without restart
- **⚡ Ollama Prioritization**: Local AI models prioritized for enhanced privacy and speed
- **� Auto-Scrolling Chat**: Seamless conversation flow with smooth auto-scrolling
- **🌐 WebSocket Integration**: Real-time communication for instant AI responses
- **� Cyberpunk UI Design**: Immersive interface with neural-themed styling and animations

### **Core Philosophy**

> *"Code should think, learn, and evolve alongside you."*

Aetherra isn't just another IDE—it's an **AI-collaborative workspace** where:

- 🧠 Your code understands context and intent
- 🤖 AI assists in real-time without interruption
- 📈 Projects grow smarter with every interaction
- 🎯 Development becomes a conversation, not a struggle
- [TOOL] The environment adapts to your workflow and improves over time

### **First Look: Aetherra in Action**

**Traditional Programming (Python):**

```python
# Calculate Fibonacci sequence

def calculate_fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return calculate_fibonacci(n-1) + calculate_fibonacci(n-2)

result = calculate_fibonacci(10)
print(f"Fibonacci(10) = {result}")
```

**Aetherra Programming:**

```aetherra

goal: calculate fibonacci sequence

think "I need the 10th fibonacci number"
calculate fibonacci(10)
display result with style="elegant"
```

**That's it!** No boilerplate, no syntax complexity. Pure intent-driven programming that reads like natural language but executes intelligently.

## 🧩 **Modular Import Structure**

**Aetherra** now uses a fully modular Python import structure. All imports should use the canonical modular paths:

```python
from aetherra_core.memory import FractalEncoder
from lyrixa_core.plugins import PluginManager
from Aetherra.plugins.agent_adapters.agent_base import AgentBase
```

**Valid import prefixes:**
- `Aetherra.`
- `Lyrixa.`
- `aetherra_core.`
- `lyrixa_core.`
- Relative imports (e.g., `from .module import X`)

**Invalid/deprecated:**
- Absolute imports outside these namespaces
- Legacy paths (e.g., `from core.plugin_api import ...`)

### Example: Canonical Imports

```python
# Good:
from aetherra_core.memory.fractal_encoder import FractalEncoder
from lyrixa_core.plugins.plugin_manager import PluginManager

# Bad (deprecated):
from core.plugin_api import register_plugin
```

### Architecture Diagram (Simplified)

## 🌌 **Introducing `.aether` Workflows**

`.aether` is Aetherra's revolutionary domain-specific language (DSL) designed for AI-native programming. It enables you to define workflows, goals, and actions in a human-readable format that Lyrixa can understand and execute.

### **Why `.aether`?**

- **Intent-Driven**: Focus on *what* you want to achieve, not *how* to do it.
- **AI-Enhanced**: Leverages Lyrixa's intelligence to execute workflows seamlessly.
- **Readable & Maintainable**: Designed to be as intuitive as natural language.


### **Example Workflow: Daily Log Summarizer**

```aether
plugin "daily_log_summarizer":
  description: "Summarizes daily system logs and stores the digest in memory"

  trigger:
    schedule: daily at "22:00"
    if memory.has("new_logs")

  memory:
    retrieve:
      from: "system.logs.daily"
      limit: 1d
    store:
      into: "summaries.logs.daily"

  ai:
    goal: "Summarize the key events from today’s logs"
    model: gpt-4o
    constraints:
      - no duplicate entries
      - include timestamps and severity levels
    output: summary_text

  actions:
    - memory.save("summaries.logs.daily", summary_text)
    - notify(user: "summary_ready", content: summary_text)

  feedback:
    expect: confirmation from user within 2h
    if no_response:
      escalate_to("admin_review_queue")
```


### **How to Use `.aether` Workflows**

1. **Create a Workflow**:

   - Write your `.aether` code in a file (e.g., `my_workflow.aether`).
   - Use the `.aether/examples/` directory for inspiration.

2. **Run the Workflow**:

   - Use the Aetherra launcher to execute your workflow:

     ```bash
     python launchers/main.py
     ```

   - Input your `.aether` code or load it from a file.

3. **Extend and Customize**:

   - Modify existing workflows or create new ones to suit your needs.
