ALTER TABLE memory_fragments ADD COLUMN emotional_valence REAL;
ALTER TABLE memory_fragments ADD COLUMN narrative_importance REAL;
ALTER TABLE memory_fragments ADD COLUMN cross_references TEXT;

-- New tables for advanced features
CREATE TABLE memory_patterns (
    pattern_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    pattern_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    confidence REAL,
    usage_frequency INTEGER,
    discovered_at TEXT

async def process_user_message(message: str, context: dict):
    # Store as episodic memory
    memory_result = await lyrixa_memory.remember(
        content=message,
        tags=extract_tags(message),
        fragment_type=MemoryFragmentType.EPISODIC,
        narrative_role="user_interaction"

    # Use hybrid recall for response generation
    relevant_memories = await lyrixa_memory.recall(
        query=message,
        recall_strategy="hybrid",
        limit=5

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Run the demo**: `python demo_memory_system.py`
2. **Review generated databases** to understand the data structures

## üéØ Expected Outcomes

By completing this roadmap, Aetherra will have:

1. **Episodic Awareness**: Understanding of how interactions connect over time

3. **Self-Reflection**: Meta-cognitive awareness of learning and development
4. **Proactive Intelligence**: Curiosity-driven exploration of knowledge gaps
5. **Robust Memory Health**: Automated maintenance and drift correction

This transformation moves Aetherra from reactive RAG responses to proactive, story-aware intelligence with genuine episodic continuity‚Äîa significant step toward more sophisticated AI consciousness.
